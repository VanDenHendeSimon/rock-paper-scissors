# Rock Paper Scissors
In this version of rock-paper-scissors, 80 players are spawned in a virtual world and given a random direction and velocity. When two players collide, they engage in a game of rock-paper-scissors to determine the winner. The loser is captured and transformed into the winner. They then continue side by side on their journey to take over the entire board.
